#### Welcome to the Beer Style Prediction Project! üçª

This repository hosts several machine learning models designed to classify beer styles based on key features like Alcohol By Volume (ABV), International Bitterness Units (IBU), and color (SRM). Our goal is to provide a robust and accurate tool for predicting beer styles, assisting brewers and enthusiasts alike in understanding and categorizing different brews.

### Key Features:

+ Machine learning models for beer style classification
+ Utilizes ABV, IBU, and color (SRM) as predictive features
+ Data and details sourced from  [Brewersfriend.com](https://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-charts/).
